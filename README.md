<h1>GDSC_UM_Android_Dev_Challenge_Dian</h1>

<p>The source code above is the <b>Diary Application (iDiary)</b> updated for the Android Development Challenge from the <b>GDSC UM Android Development Workshop</b>. There have already been functions that allow users to <b>sign in with Google</b> and <b>add the diary (Title, Description, Image)</b>. A few modifications have been made to the <b>login UI</b> for a new function, as well as the <b>Main Activity UI</b> for a better user experience.
 <br><br> The application's new feature allows users to <b>sign in using their email address and password, as well as using biometric (fingerprint) authentication</b>. Following that, there is a feature that allows the user to<b> remove </b>the diary that has been uploaded to the application. However, the delete function is not linked to the firebase, thus the remove action will take place just in the GUI. </p>

<p> The biometric (fingerprint) function will work as below:</p>
 <p><i>  1.   The biometric (fingerprint) is first invisible.<br> 2.   The user must first log in using their email address (trialapp@gmail.com) and password (123_try_App).<br> 3.   Once a person has signed in, they may sign out whenever they wish.<br> 4.   As soon as the user signs out, a fingerprint picture will appear beneath the login button.<br> 5.   To utilise the fingerprint function, users must first click the fingerprint picture and then scan their fingerprint to have access to the diary applicaiton.</i></p>
